## Continuum Mechanics

### Stress & Strain Fundamentals

- Stress: Internal force per unit area; represented by a second-order tensor capturing how traction depends on plane orientation.
- Normal stress: Component of stress perpendicular to a plane; tension positive, compression negative.
- Strain: Dimensionless measure of deformation defined as change in length divided by original length; tracks fiber stretch or shortening.
- Normal strain: Axial strain aligned with the member or fiber direction; governs elongation or contraction under axial loading.
- Young's modulus: Material stiffness constant `E` defining the slope of the linear elastic stress-strain curve in uniaxial tension or compression.

### Elastic Behavior

- Linear elasticity: Regime where stress is proportional to strain and deformations are fully recoverable after unloading.
- Hookean material: Ideal linear elastic solid obeying Hooke's law (`sigma = E * epsilon`) within its elastic limit.
- Non-Hookean material: Exhibits nonlinear stress-strain response such as plasticity, hyperelasticity, or viscoelasticity; tangent or secant moduli depend on load level and history.

### Energy Concepts

- Conservation of energy: For an isolated mechanical system, total energy remains constant; in quasi-static structural problems, external work balances the increase in internal strain energy.
- Energy principle: Minimum total potential energy states that among kinematically admissible displacement fields, the actual equilibrium configuration minimizes `Pi = U - W`, where `U` is strain energy and `W` is work of external loads.
- Elastic energy: Strain energy stored during reversible deformation; for linear elastic bodies `U = (1/2) * integral(sigma : epsilon dV)`, reducing to `sigma^2 / (2E)` for axial members.

### Loading Regimes & Dissipation

- Quasistatic loading: Evolves slowly enough that inertial forces are negligible compared to static equilibrium forces.
- Damping: Mechanisms that dissipate vibrational energy (material hysteresis, friction, fluid drag); characterized by damping ratio, loss factor, or complex stiffness.
- Inertial losses: Energy consumed in repeatedly accelerating masses or entrained media during cyclic motion; appears as apparent damping and reduces dynamic amplification.
