1. Equilibrium - Condition where net force and net moment on a body are zero.
2. Equations of Equilibrium - In 2D: ΣFx = 0, ΣFy = 0, ΣM = 0.
3. Force Systems
 3.1. Colinear Forces - Lines of action lie on the same straight line; combine algebraically along that line.
 3.2. Non-colinear Forces - Lines of action are not the same line; require vector sums and can induce a resultant moment.
 3.3. Couple - Two equal, opposite, parallel forces separated by distance; zero net force, pure moment M = F·d independent of point.
4. Resultants - An equivalent single force and/or moment that replaces a system of forces.
5. Moment - Tendency of a force to cause rotation about a point or axis.
6. Loads
 6.1. Dead Loads - Permanent, static loads from self-weight and fixed construction.
 6.2. Live Loads - Transient, movable loads from occupancy and use.
7. Types of Support
 7.1. Fixed Support - Restrains translation and rotation; provides force and moment reactions.
 7.2. Pin Support - Restrains translation, allows rotation; provides two force reactions, no moment.
 7.3. Roller Support - Restrains one direction only, allows rotation and in-plane movement; provides a single normal reaction.
8. Structural Elements
 8.1. Beam - Member primarily resisting bending from transverse loads; typically horizontal.
 8.2. Column - Compression member primarily resisting axial load; buckling governs slender members.
 8.3. Cantilever - Member fixed at one end and free at the other.
9. Material and Section Behavior
 9.1. Stress - Internal force per area; normal component due to axial/bending actions.
 9.2. Tension - Axial action causing elongation; induces tensile normal stress.
 9.3. Compression - Axial action causing shortening; may trigger buckling in slender members.
 9.4. Shear Stress - Tangential stress from transverse shear or torsion; drives sliding along planes.
 9.5. Bending - Internal moment causing curvature; tension on one side, compression on the other.
 9.6. Torsion - Twisting due to applied torque; produces shear stress over the cross-section.
 9.7. Young's Modulus - Material stiffness parameter E; slope of elastic stress–strain.
 9.8. Stiffness - Structural resistance to deformation (k = load/deflection); depends on E and geometry.
 9.9. Strength - Capacity before failure (yield/ultimate limits); governs allowable stress/load.
10. Determinacy
 10.1. Statically Determinate - Unknowns = equilibrium equations; solvable by equilibrium only.
 10.2. Statically Indeterminate - Unknowns > equations; need compatibility. Degree n = excess unknowns.
11. Stability - Stable: no rigid-body motion; Unstable: mechanism. Determinacy ≠ stability.
