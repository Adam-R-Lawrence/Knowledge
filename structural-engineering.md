## Structural Engineering

- Equilibrium: Condition where net force and net moment on a body are zero.
- Equations of equilibrium: In 2D, ΣFx = 0, ΣFy = 0, ΣM = 0.
- Force systems:
  - Colinear forces: Lines of action on the same straight line; combine algebraically along that line.
  - Non-colinear forces: Lines of action differ; require vector sums and can induce a resultant moment.
  - Couple: Two equal, opposite, parallel forces separated by distance; zero net force, pure moment M = F·d independent of point.
- Resultants: An equivalent single force and/or moment that replaces a system of forces.
- Moment: Tendency of a force to cause rotation about a point or axis.
- Loads:
  - Dead loads: Permanent, static loads from self-weight and fixed construction.
  - Live loads: Transient, movable loads from occupancy and use.
- Types of support:
  - Fixed support: Restrains translation and rotation; provides force and moment reactions.
  - Pin support: Restrains translation, allows rotation; provides two force reactions, no moment.
  - Roller support: Restrains one direction only; allows rotation and in-plane movement; provides a single normal reaction.
- Structural elements:
  - Beam: Member primarily resisting bending from transverse loads; typically horizontal.
  - Column: Compression member primarily resisting axial load; buckling governs slender members.
  - Cantilever: Member fixed at one end and free at the other.
- Material and section behavior:
  - Stress: Internal force per area; normal component due to axial/bending actions.
  - Tension: Axial action causing elongation; induces tensile normal stress.
  - Compression: Axial action causing shortening; may trigger buckling in slender members.
  - Shear stress: Tangential stress from transverse shear or torsion; drives sliding along planes.
  - Bending: Internal moment causing curvature; tension on one side, compression on the other.
  - Torsion: Twisting due to applied torque; produces shear stress over the cross-section.
  - Young's modulus: Material stiffness parameter E; slope of elastic stress–strain.
  - Stiffness: Structural resistance to deformation (k = load/deflection); depends on E and geometry.
  - Strength: Capacity before failure (yield/ultimate limits); governs allowable stress/load.
- Determinacy:
  - Statically determinate: Unknowns equal equilibrium equations; solvable by equilibrium only.
  - Statically indeterminate: Unknowns exceed equations; need compatibility. Degree n = excess unknowns.
- Stability: Stable means no rigid-body motion; unstable forms a mechanism. Determinacy ≠ stability.
