## Polymer Chemistry

### Photopolymerization

- Polymers: Macromolecules composed of repeating monomer units.
- Covalent bonds: Shared-electron chemical bonds within polymer chains.
- Ionic bonds: Electrostatic attractions between charged species.
- Stokes shift: Difference between excitation and emission peak wavelengths.
- Fluorescence: Light emission from an excited singlet state returning to ground state.
- Kasha's rule: Emission wavelength is independent of excitation wavelength.
- Photochemical reaction: Chemical change initiated by light absorption.
- FRET: Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between donor and acceptor chromophores.
- Excited state: Higher-energy electronic state populated after photon absorption.
- Radicals: Reactive species with unpaired electrons; drive chain-growth polymerization.
- Vitrification: Transition of a system into a glassy, rigid state during curing.
- Glass transition temperature (Tg): Temperature where amorphous polymers shift between glassy and rubbery behavior.
- Amorphous polymers: Chains organized in a disordered, non-crystalline fashion.
- Brittle: Material behavior with low strain-to-failure and sudden fracture.
- Ductile: Material behavior allowing significant plastic deformation before failure.
- Red shift: Movement of spectral features toward longer wavelengths.
- Inner-filter effect: Apparent fluorescence changes due to absorption/re-absorption in the sample.
